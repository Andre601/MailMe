# FAQ

## I've received an IncompleteBuilderException

Typically, this is not directly from MailMe and is actually produced by another plugin using MailMe's API. 

Contact the developer of the plugin causing the issue in order to resolve your problem.

There's not much more that I can do for you in regards to the error other than this is produced when someone tried to send mail without all the paramaters.

## Can I have a feature implementing?

Potentially!

MailMe is always looking to increase its feature list and provide a better experience for you. Although, we have a few restrictions in place for this:

* Suggestion must be relevant to plugin function. Example: We won't put a trading system into the plugin as the main function is to send and receive mail between players - not trade items.
* Suggestion must be useful for everybody. This means if you have a private plugin and you want the plugin to link in with it, we won't do it for the main jar. However, the plugin has an extensive API so you could look at using that or providing another developer with it.
* Suggestion can't be already implemented \(duh\)

## How do I use the plugin

On the left hand side panel under the title MailMe, you can view some tutorials on how to use the plugin. This may also be useful to your players that haven't used the plugin before!

## My question isn't answered here!

That's a statement bucky!
